# GPG Encrypt a Maildir using gpgit.pl, removing any S= or W= virtual flags.

# Change log:
#     Aug 4, 2012 (Etienne Perot)
#               - Remove third argument
#               - Changed default encryption mode to PGP/MIME (gpgit default)
#               - No need to specify path to gpgit.pl (assumes it is next to this script)
#               - No full paths to binaries
#               - Harmonize indentation
#               - Rename variables to better names
#               - Don't use a temporary file to keep track of program state
#               - Remove security vulnerability during which the (encrypted) message could be read by anyone able to read /tmp for a short while
#     Sep 03, 2011
#               - Temporary file is based on file_owner to avoid issues with permission differences.
#               - Temporary file is removed after run.
#               - Optional arguments passed to 'find'.
#               - Full paths to binaries.
#               - Removed unneccessary need of 'cat', 'grep', etc.
#     Sep 04, 2011
#               - Don't remove Dovecot index/uid unless messages have been GPG encrypted.
#               - Adjust file tests to not just use -e
#               - Quote all file operations
#     Sep 05, 2011
#               - Don't arbitrarily copy files, only overwrite the file in ~/Maildir if it differs after calling gpgencmail.pl
#               - Only rebuild the index if we have modified ~/Maildir
